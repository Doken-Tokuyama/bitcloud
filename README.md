We are in the early stages of developing the protocol that will change the world forever.
We are calling it Bitcloud, to separate it from Wetube, which is the interface. The main important features are:

    We are generating money from bandwidth sharing instead of mining!
    We introduce optional moderators to make the content of our net of very high quality (anyone can become a moderator).
    We optionally protect the IP and identity of the users and nodes that share delicate content
    And we have a blockchain too! But quiet different from actual ones.
    We don't initially own 100% of the coins like in Mastercoin or Next


**YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH US IN THIS VERY EARLY PROCESS AND BECOME PART OF THE  TEAM DOING THE MAIN DECISIONS.**

In contrast to what Invictus and Mastercoin is doing (centralizing development and investment), I want, as an experiment, to make this process REALLY open, allowing anyone who wants to participate to share his opinion.

We are contacting developers and thinkers only now, as we don't want this project to become mainstream until we have something to really work in and a good bunch of developers.
Please, spread the word between developers, marketers, thinkers, and similar people. There is no way that 1, 2 or 5 people can do this big project alone. We must go together.

We are in #wetube at freenode. You can also contact me by PM and/or mail.
